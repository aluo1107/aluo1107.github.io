    <h2> My Journey</h2>
    <p> I came into <em> Cornell University</em> as an Environmental Engineering major, but after taking an introductory course to computer science using the coding language Python, I fell in love with coding and explored more of the computing industry. </p>

    <p> When I was exploring, I found out about Information Science and decided that this was the career path I want to take. I realized I had a passion for designing websites and building applications that other people can use. </p>

    <h2> My Hobbies</h2>
    <p> In my free time, I love bowling, spending time with friends, and taking walks.</p>

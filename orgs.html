                <li> Rawlings Scholars are Undergraduate students who were selected because they have shown interest in research in high school or during their first two years at Cornell.</li>
                <li>RCPRS supports their scholars by providing a $8000 support account ($5000 if admitted as juniors) to help fund expenses while pursuing their research</li>
                <li>This money can be used for pay if research is done for wage or to help fund living and travel expenses if needed.</li>
                <li>In addition to the expectation of research every semester (excluding first semester of freshman year), scholars are expected to complete 1 summer of full-time research.</li>
                <li>Scholars choose the faculty mentor they want to work under join projects they have a passion to pursue. </li>
